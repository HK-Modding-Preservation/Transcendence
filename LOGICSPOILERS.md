# Logic Options

Each of the logic options corresponds to a charm, and enables progression paths which utilize that
charm. Some paths rely on a combination of charms; those are only enabled if all relevant charms are
toggled on in these options.

- **Antigravity Amulet**: includes high jumps (including Claw and Wings jumps), traversal of some horizontal
  gaps (where allowed by the ceiling height), and additional airstall skips.
- **Bluemoth Wings**: includes unlimited air jumps. Movement that needs the use of this charm requires the 
  ability to replenish Geo (the same as is required for toll benches) to be in logic.
  If "On With Geo" is selected, Millibelle's Blessing (if its logic option is on) or the ability to visit
  Lemm and Trial of the Warrior is also required.
- **Snail Soul**: treats Snail Soul plus Vengeful Spirit as equivalent to Shade Soul for combat logic purposes.
- **Snail Slash**: includes pogo chains that pogo the same enemy more times than Old Nail (AKA nail 0) allows, and/or use the additional soul generated from the pogos for airstalls.
- **Millibelle's Blessing**: treats Millibelle's Blessing as a large geo source for Bluemoth Wings, Crystalmaster, and the Ancient Basin fountain
- **Nitro Crystal**: is a baldur killer in combination with Crystal Heart
- **Vespa's Vengeance**: is a baldur killer in combation with Howling Wraiths or Abyss Shriek
- **Crystalmaster**: includes traversal of horizontal gaps using the increased movement speed. Some gaps
  will also require airstalls and/or Antigravity Amulet to cross. As with Bluemoth Wings, this requires
  the ability to replenish Geo, and an equivalent "On With Geo" option is also available.
