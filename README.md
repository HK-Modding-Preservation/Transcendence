A mod for Hollow Knight that adds 14 new charms.

Can work with or without the randomizer: if it is in use and charms are randomized,
the charms are shuffled into the pool, otherwise they are placed at set hidden
locations.

See SPOILERS.md for a description of what the charms do and their vanilla locations and notch costs.
